"""
This script generates a crossword puzzle using constraint satisfaction programming. It includes a 
main function that reads the crossword structure and word list from files, creates a Crossword 
and CrosswordCreator object, and then attempts to solve the crossword. If a solution is found, 
it is printed to the terminal and optionally saved as an image file.

Usage:
    python generate.py structure words [output]

Where:
    'structure' is a file defining the structure of the crossword,
    'words' is a file containing a list of words to use in the crossword,
    'output' is an optional argument specifying the name of the file to save the crossword image.
